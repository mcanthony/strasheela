    <h1>IntroMusicRepresentation</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<p>To represent more complex music than a scale we need a more expressive music representation.</p>

<p>Generate a simple score and output it. <code>Score.makeScore</code> expects a
literal score representation consisting of records and returns a
score object. Each record in the literal score representation is an
init method to create a score object (which optionally contains
other score objects), i.e. score object attributes can be set by
specifying init record features.</p>


<pre class="example">
declare
MyScore = {Score.makeScore
	   seq(items: [note(duration: 4
			    pitch: 60
			    amplitude: 80)
		       note(duration: 4
			    pitch: 64
			    amplitude: 80)
		       note(duration: 4
			    pitch: 67
			    amplitude: 80)]
	       startTime:0
	       %% duration 1 corresponds to 1/4 beats, i.e. duration
	       %% one is a 1/16th note.
	       timeUnit:beats(4))
	   unit}
</pre>

<p>There are various ways to look at scores</p>

<p>Look at the object without inspecting it.</p>

<pre class="example">{Browse MyScore}</pre>


<p>To inspect the score nesting and parameter values (see
toPPrintRecord doc for additional args)
{Browse {MyScore toPPrintRecord($)}}</p>

<p>To see all score object attributes (see toFullRecord doc for
additional args)
{Browse {MyScore toFullRecord($)}}</p>

<p>To transform the object back into an init record (e.g. for
archiving purposes after a successful search).
{Browse {MyScore toInitRecord($)}}</p>

<p>To listing to the score (you need to have Csound and a sound file player installed and some Strasheela environment variables set correctly). See the doc for more arguments.
{Out.renderAndPlayCsound MyScore unit}</p>

<p>To view the score in common music notation (you need to have lilypond and a PDF viewer installed and some Strasheela environment variables set correctly). See the doc for more arguments.
{Out.renderAndShowLilypond MyScore unit}</p>


<p>Many unset score parameters are often implicitly bound to FD
integers (for details on the init defaults see the class
definitions in ScoreCore.oz). Such parameters can be searched for in a script.
declare
MyScore = {Score.makeScore</p>

<center>
<p class="quoted">seq(items: [note note note])
unit}</p>
</center>

<p>{Browse {MyScore toPPrintRecord($)}}</p>


<p>However, it is often sensible to set some parameters directly by
hand. This is most often true for the startTime of the full score
 &mdash; leaving the startTime unset would greatly increase the size of
the search space without any further use.</p>

<p>For output into various formats it is also necessary to set the
timeUnit (the timeUnits of all objects are unified). See the doc of
the class TimeParameter for details.</p>
