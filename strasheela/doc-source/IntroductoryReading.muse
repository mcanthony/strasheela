#title Introductory Reading

This tutorial can not really introduce the Oz programming language itself. [[OzDocumentation][Oz is already very well documented]]. Still, the massive amount of documentation may discourage a musician mainly interested in Strasheela itself. Therefore, I recommend to read at least the following texts to get started with Strasheela. 

  - The [[http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/tutorial/index.html][Tutorial of Oz]] explains the basics. I recommend to read at least chapter 1-7 plus 10

  - [[http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/index.html][Finite Domain Constraint Programming in Oz. A Tutorial]] introduces how constraint programming is done in Oz. In particular, consider chapter 1-3, 5, and 8.
  
  - The thesis [[http://strasheela.sourceforge.net/documents/TorstenAnders-PhDThesis.pdf][Composing Music by Composing Rules: Design and Usage of a Generic Music Constraint System]] explains the design of Strasheela in detail. I particularly recommend reading the chapters 4-7.
