* -- Music Constraint Programming

** intro

The following sections introduce music constraint programming with Strasheela.

*Please note that this part of the tutorial is still unfinished!*
  


* A Dummy Example

** intro

This section is extremely simple: you could easily create its result without constraint programming. Nevertheless, because it is so simple this section helps you do understand the basic structure of a typical Strasheela section.

The constraint script for this section is a unary procedure (as was explained above in the section "A Simple Script"). The single argument of a Strasheela constraint script is the solution score. The script creates the solution score MyScore, consisting of a sequence container with three notes, where the domain of each notes pitch is the set {60, ..., 72} (i.e., the pitches of the octave above middle c -- the pitchUnit is its default keynumber). Then the section applies the constraint that in every pair of two neighbouring notes, the pitch of the later note is higher. 

This script is handed to a constraint solver. For convenience, Strasheela provides custom constraint solvers which resemble the standard Oz solvers, but which add special support for searching for Strasheela scores. The solver of this section is SDistro.searchOne. Like the standard solver SearchOne, SearchOne searches for a single solution, which is retured in a list. In contrast to SearchOne, however, SDistro.searchOne expects two arguments. The first argument is the script and the second argument is a specification of the search strategy (distribution strategy) to use. Here, this specification is just unit, that is, the default settings are used.

/* This section is essentially the same as the previous one, but more
terse. All comments are stripped out, and the notes in the score are
not all explicitly noted. Instead, a list with all pitch variables is
created: FD.list returns a list of FD integers (try changing the
number of notes and the pitch variable domains..). This list is then
transformed into note declarations using Map (Map was explained in the
section "Higher-Order Programming"). */

Do settings for different program path names as explained before

Note for developer: output dir is always default (ie. /tmp) and this can not be changed in settings GUI yet

* Score Distribution Strategies

** intro

Show how to use various predefined score distribution strategies. 

One of Strasheela's major strength is that it allows you to define your own score distribution strategies -- optimised for your specific musical CSP. Although the definition of score distribution strategies is beyond this tutorial, it is already discussed in detail in the thesis "Composing Music by Composing Rules: Design and Usage of a Generic Music Constraint System", Chap. 7 (http://strasheela.sourceforge.net/documents/TorstenAnders-PhDThesis.pdf). This chapter also points to further relevant Oz documentation.

* More Information

** intro

This tutorial provided an overview of important Strasheela concepts and demonstrated them with many sections. It concludes with references to further Strasheela documentation. 

The fundamental concepts and the design of Strasheela is detailed in my thesis "Composing Music by Composing Rules: Design and Usage of a Generic Music Constraint System" (http://strasheela.sourceforge.net/documents/TorstenAnders-PhDThesis.pdf). This text also compares Strasheela carefully with other similar systems. 

The sections in this tutorial are all rather short and explain only specific matters. More elaborated sections can be found at strasheela/doc/StrasheelaExamples.html. 

This tutorial gave an overview of various Strasheela functionality. The Strasheela reference documentation at strasheela/doc/StrasheelaReference.html (hopefully) explains every Strasheela construct (procedure, class, ...) in detail. In addition, the usage of most Strasheela constructs is also demonstrated in several test cases in Strasheela's test files. The test files for the Strasheela core are situated in strasheela/testing/. 

The reference documentation and test files for various Strasheela extensions are (usually) found in the directory of the respective extension. The writing of such an extension is demonstrated in a contribution template at strasheela/contributions/ExtensionTemplate/. This template also explains how to write your own Strasheela classes in strasheela/contributions/ExtensionTemplate/source/ClassDefinitionDemo.oz

In case you have specific questions, please consider contacting the strasheela-users mailing list (https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/strasheela-users).

Finally, if all else fails, the Strasheela source itself can serve as documentation. I really tried to make the code readable for other users as well... 

Have fun with Strasheela!
