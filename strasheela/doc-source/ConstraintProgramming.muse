* -- Constraint Programming

** Introduction

The following sections introduce the basics of constraint programming in Oz.



* Variables and Constraints

** Introduction

A Contraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is defined as a tuple consisting of

  - A finite set of variables,
  - Each of which has a finite domain,
  - A finite set of constraints which limit the values which the variables may simultaneously take.



** Variables domains

The two variables X and Y are declared to integers with a specific domain of allowed values (finite domain, FD).  X is explicitly declared to an integer in {0, ..., 10}. Y is declared to any integer supported by Oz (so you see the maximum integer domain supported by Oz).

Please note that a finite domain consists always of integers in Oz (for efficiency reasons), and that FD integers cannot be negative. There are also other domains supported (e.g. sets of finite integers are build-in, and real numbers are available as a third-party extension). 


<src lang="oz">
local 
  X = {FD.int 0#10}
  Y = {FD.decl}
in
  {Browse [X Y]}
end
</src>

** Constraint Propagation

This section declares two finite domain integers as the section before. In addition, it states that X is greater than Y. The domain of both variables are automatically reduced, so that all domain values potentially fulfill the greater-than constraint. 

However, no specific solution is shown. The next section shows how to search for solutions of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) in Oz.


<src lang="oz">
local 
  X = {FD.int 0#10}
  Y = {FD.decl}
in
  X >: Y
  {Browse [X Y]}
end
</src>

* Solving CSPs

** Introduction

This section introduces constraint solvers.



** A Simple Script

This section shows the first full constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) definition.  A constraint solver (here SearchAll) expects a CSP in form of a script.  A script is a procedure (MyScript) whose only argument is the solution of the solved CSP.  This variable is often called the "root variable" of the script.  Transformed into common mathematical notation, the CSP states the following conjunction

  X + Y = Z  AND  X < Y

The script simply collects the three variables X, Y, and Z in a record stored in the root variable Solution.  The solver SearchAll returns a list with all solutions of the problem defined by the script.  Note the use of the special constraint operators (e.g., `<:' instead of `<').


<src lang="oz">
local
  proc {MyScript Solution}
     X = {FD.int 1#10}
     Y = {FD.int 1#10}
     Z = {FD.int 1#10}
  in
     Solution = unit(x:X y:Y z:Z)
     X + Y =: Z
     X <: Y
     %% search strategy
     {FD.distribute naive Solution}
  end
in
  {Browse {SearchAll MyScript}}
end
</src>

** Oz Explorer

This example uses another constraint solver, the Oz Explorer.  The Explorer visualises the search space.  Green nodes in the tree denote solutions, red nodes represent a fail, blue nodes show a stage in the search where there are still open decisions.  Triangles represent a subtree (use the middle mouse button to show the nodes of the subtree).

Just double-click on a node to see the values of the variables at this stage during the search process (you cannot look at failed nodes, though).  Note that you may need to select a suitable Explorer action first: in the menu Nodes select Information Action -> Inspect (the other actions are intended for Strasheela score processing).  You can use the Explorer to get some intuitive understanding of the search process.  For example, look first at the variable values in the root node, than in a child node of the root and in a grand-child node and so forth, to monitor how the search process shrinks the variable domains.

You may play around with the menu entries of the Oz Explorer.  For example, select the top node with the mouse, then go to the 'Search' menu and select 'Next Solution'.


<src lang="oz">
local
  proc {MyScript Solution}
     X = {FD.int 1#10}
     Y = {FD.int 1#10}
     Z = {FD.int 1#10}
  in
     Solution = unit(x:X y:Y z:Z)
     X + Y =: Z
     X <: Y
     %% search strategy
     {FD.distribute naive Solution}
  end
in
  {ExploreOne MyScript}
end
</src>

** Parameterised Script

This section defines a script which expects an argument -- a parameterised script.  IncreasingInts expects an integer L and returns the actual script (an anonymous procedure).  This script creates a list of L finite domain integers (using FD.list).  It then constrains all integers in this list to be pairwise distinct (using the constraint FD.distinct).  In addition, it constrains the sum of all integers to be equal the square of L (using FD.sum).

You may also edit the CSP definition.  For example, change the value for L in the IncreasingInts call to another integer.


<src lang="oz">
local
   fun {IncreasingInts L}
      proc {$ Sol}
	 %% create a list of L FD integers with domain {0, ..., L*2}
	 Sol = {FD.list L 0#L*2}
         {FD.distinct Sol}
         {FD.sum Sol '=:' L*L}
	 %% search strategy
	 {FD.distribute ff Sol}
      end
   end
in
   {ExploreOne {IncreasingInts 7}}
end
</src>

** Distribution Strategy

In Oz, we have great control over the search process.  One important aspect is the distribution strategy, often defined in the last line of a script.  The procedure FD.distribute expects a specification of a distribution strategy and a record or list of the constrained variables.

The distribution strategy specifies in which order variables are visited during the search process.  For example, the naive distribution simply visits variables in their order.  The first-fail (ff) distribution, on the other hand, always visits next a variable with smallest domain and for which a solution is therefore harder to find.  The selection of a suitable distribution strategy is vital for the performance of the search process.  

The following example demonstrates this with an example, the Send More Money Puzzle.  The example defines the following equation, where distinct letters stand for distinct digits. 

  SEND + MORE = MONEY 

This equation has only a single solution. 

  9567 + 1085 = 10652

Select different distribution strategies and observe how the size of the search tree changes (there are 3 failed notes with first fail, and 6 failed notes with naive distribution).  This example is discussed in more detail in the "Finite Domain Constraint Programming Tutorial", section 3.2

proc {Money Root}
   S E N D M O R Y
in 
   Root = sol(s:S e:E n:N d:D m:M o:O r:R y:Y)      
   Root ::: 0#9                            % set domain for all digits           
   {FD.distinct Root}                               
   S \=: 0                                 % first digits must not be 0         
   M \=: 0
   1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D               % define equation
   +            1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E
   =: 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y
   {FD.distribute naive Root}              % define distribution 
%   {FD.distribute ff Root}
end
{ExploreAll Money}
</src>

** BACKGROUND

Terms: Variable, constraint, solver, distribution

This section presented constraint programming basics: how constraint satisfaction problems are defined as scripts, and how constraint solvers solve these problems.  For keeping things simple, we did not cover any details, in particular we did not discuss constraint distribution in detail.  For more information, please see the Oz documentation.
