* -- Strasheela's Music Representation

** intro

The following sections introduce various aspects of Strasheela's music representation. The representation is then later used for defining musical constraint satisfaction problems. 



** Implicit pattern matching in Strasheela

The following function GetPitch expects a record as argument which must match the record note(pitch:Pitch ...).  The variable Pitch is implicitly declared and bound to the value at the feature 'pitch' of the record given as argument to the function.

Please note that the record in the header of the function GetPitch is not even complete but contains three dots (...) to indicate that further record features are possible.


<src lang="oz">

   fun {GetPitch note(pitch:Pitch ...)}
      Pitch
   end
in
   {Inspect {GetPitch note(duration:4 pitch:60)}}
end
</src>

* Score Creation

** intro

This section creates a Strasheela score, consisting of a single note. The score is specified textually, and this specification is then transformed into a score object instance. A textual representation, on the one hand, is conveniently entered and edited. A score object instance, on the other hand, has the advantage that many operations are already defined for it. For section, there are various operations available for accessing score information and for outputting a score into other formats (e.g. Csound or Lilypond). The textual score format and the interface of a score object (i.e. the operations it understands) are explained later. 

The created score object is shown by the Inspector. The Inspector shows <O: Note>, where the O says that this is an object, and Note is the name of its class. However, the Inspector also allows you to look 'inside' a score object via the object's context menu (typically right-mouseclick, but happens to be the middle-mouse key on my Mac...). Select 'Filter' -> 'Show Textual Score'. This shows the score in the textual form as entered in the section. Note also that the background color behind the score changed to indicate that we are now 'looking into' something. You can 'go back' to the original view by the context menu entry 'unmap' (you have to right-click on the top-level label note). 

The Inspector also provides different views on the score via the other 'Filter' context menu entries. These provide more information on the internal structure of a score object. For section, 'Show Score Hierarchy Recursively' reveals that even a plain note is internally represented hiearchically: the note parameters (e.g. duration, pitch) are represented by their own objects.

* Sound Output

** intro

This section creates a Strasheela score consisting of three notes. The first section saves a Csound score file (with the procedure Out.outputCsoundScore). The second and third sections additionally call Csound in the background and open the resulting sound file with an editor (with the procedure Out.renderAndPlayCsound). Note that these sections requires that you specified where Csound is installed on your system and what sound file editor you want to use (see 'Settings...' in the Tutorial menu).

This section introduces Strasheela containers: three notes are contained in a simultaneous container (sim). This container expresses how the notes are temporally arranged. The startTime of notes in a simultaneous container is their offsetTime plus the startTime of the encapsulating simultaneous container (which is 0 here). Thus, in this section the first note starts at 0, the second at 500, and the third at 1500.

The temporal structure of the score is specified in milliseconds, as the timeUnit argument of this container indicates. Please note that the timeUnit must be specified only once in a score. This setting is shared by all temporal score objects (i.e. the container and the notes). 

The sections demonstrate different ways to specify the output file(s). In the first two sections, the path is specified textually in two components: directory and file name (the extension .sco is added automatically). For section, the first section outputs the file "/tmp/test.sco". You may change these settings by editing the arguments scoDir (the directory for the sco file), soundDir (the directory for the resulting sound file), and file (the file name without extension). Windows users will have to input a directory path like, for section, "C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\" (German settings..). In the third section, the output file is specified with a file dialog for convenience. BTW: most directory arguments of output procedures (e.g., scoDir soundDir of Out.renderAndPlayCsound) can be omitted; their default value are directories set in the Strasheela environment (cf. the _ozrc file in the Strasheela directory for an section how to set these default directories).

Please note that the shell (or Dos) where you started this tutorial provides feedback. It confirms the writing of the Csound score file, shows the call to Csound resulting from your settings etc. When you are using Strasheela from within the OPI, the Emacs buffer 'Oz Emulator' shows this information. 

Please have a look at the content of the resulting Csound score file (on UNIX, you may just uncomment the last line of the first section). You will notice that the Csound p-fields p2 and p3 (i.e. the second and third columns) correspond to the notes' offset time and duration, now measured in Csound beats (note the Csound tempo specification above, which can be changed with the procedure Init.setTempo, but defaults to 60.0). Moreover, p4 is the amplitude (measure as midi velocity value in the section and now normalised in 0-1) and p5 is the pitch (measured as midi keynumber). In strasheela/goodies/csound you will find a demo Csound orc file which works with these settings. This file is used in the second and third section. 

The section requires to wait with the Csound output until all score information not explicitly specified (e.g. the start time of the notes) is propagated in the background. Remember that Oz is a concurrent programming languages: propagation of such score information happens concurrently 'behind the scene'. The wait method blocks until all parameter values in the score are determined (we will not need it later in actual CSPs).

* Sheet Music Output

** intro

This section creates a hierarchically nested score and outputs it to sheet music. The previous section presented the simultaneous container (sim), which arranges its contained score objects simultaneously in time. The present section introduces the sequential container (seq), which arranges its contained score objects sequentially in time. The section demonstrates that simultaneous and sequential containers can be arbitrarily nested. 

In the previous section, the timeUnit was set to milliseconds. Here, it is set to beats(4), which means that the duration 4 indicates a quarter-note (a beat) and consequently duration 1 is a sixteenth-note. In general, all musical parameters support some unit of measurement which indicates how the numeric parameter value is interpreted (in particular for output into export formats). For section, the pitchUnit defaults to (MIDI) 'keynumber', but can also be set to midicent, frequency, or et72 (i.e. equal temperament with 72 steps per octave). These various parameter units of measurements are supported, because Strasheela parameter values are (at least presently) always integers. Whereas the timeUnit must be set only once in the score, other units can be set individually for every score object. The timeUnit is handled differently, because Strasheela implicitly applies some constraints to all temporal parameters (e.g., the temporal structure in sequential and simultaneous containers is enforced by constraints), and these constraints require a consistent timeUnit for all parameters.

The first section outputs the music to a PDF file (using Lilypond). The second section outputs to a MusicXML file (using Fomus), which can be opened, for section, by software like Finale and Sibelius. Fomus supports outputting into further formats and supports tweaking the MusicXML output specifically for Finale or Sibelius usage: just set the appropriate Fomus flag in the section below (see the Fomus documentation for the supported flags). Please note that for running these sections you must specify (via 'Settings...' menu entry) where Strasheela can find the applications lilypond, convert-ly (an application part of Lilypond), a PDF file viewer, and Fomus.

* Specifying and Accessing Basic Score Object Information

** intro

Various information about score objects can be stored and retrieved from Strasheela's music representation. This information is used for formulating music theory models. For section, a musical CSP may specify a score where all note pitch variables are initialised to certain domains, and neighbouring melodic notes are then accessed and constrained.

The textual music representation allows for the convenient definition of complex scores, as already shown by the previous sections. The interface defined for Strasheela score objects, on the other hand, simplifies the access to score information. As shown before, the textual representation is transformed into a score object with the function Score.makeScore. Vice versa, a score object can be transformed into its textual representation (see below for an section). Using the textual representation and Score.makeScore is strongly recommended for creating Strasheela score objects, because it hides low-level details of the score object creation process. 

This section introduces the textual music representation format in more detail. In general, a textual score is a (often nested) Oz record. Record labels correspond with score classes, and record features are initialisation arguments for the class creation. This was already demonstrated in previous sections. In the following, specific aspects are introduced in more detail by sections. For additional information and sections of the textual representation please see the Score.makeScore reference documentation (strasheela/doc/api/node6.html#entity225) and and the Score.makeScore sections in strasheela/testing/ScoreCore-test.oz. 

The section also demonstrates the retrieval of various basic information. Basic information includes access to object parameter values (e.g. the pitch of a note), checking the type (class) of an object (e.g. checking whether object X is a note), checking the identity of two objects, and exploring the hierarchic structure of a score. Later sections will show how you can access more complex information. 

The naming of many methods and functions accessing basic information follows common conventions. Such convensions are briefly summarised here. The name of accessor methods usually start with 'get' as in getSomething (e.g., getDuration, getPitch, getContainers). Type-checking methods usually start with 'is' (e.g., isNote, isPause). Methods which check a has-a relation often start with 'has' (hasSuccessor, hasThisInfo). Converters start often with 'to' or contain 'to' in their name (e.g. toInitRecord, but also Int.toFloat). The name of many constructors starts with 'make' (Score.makeScore, Score.makeClass).

simultaneous container) is usually specified in the textual score with
the name of the parameter as a record feature (e.g. duration), and

following section initialises and accesses the duration of a
simultaneous container. */

** Default parameter values

No information available.

for score object to create (e.g., sets the pitch of a note, or the
duration of a sequential container). Most of these initialisation
arguments are optional, and Strasheela defines a default value for
these initialisation arguments. For section, parameter values such as
durations and pitches default to a constrained variable.

This section creates a single note and specifies no initialisation
arguments at all. You can inspect the note's parameters and their
default values (mostly undetermined constrained variables). In the
Inspector, use the note's context menu: 'Filter' -> 'Show Score
Hierarchy Recursively'. 

An undetermined parameter value is accessed the same way as a
determined parameter. For section, a note's undetermined pitch is
accessed with the method getPitch. Accessing undetermined parameter
values is important for constraining these values. */

section, see strasheela/doc/api/class25.html for the superclasses of

section, for being able to apply a constraint to all notes and pauses
but not to the containers these objects contained in (possibly deeply
nested).

Strasheela uses the following terminolody. Every Strasheela object is
a ScoreObject. Strasheela distinguishes between Parameters (e.g. the
pitch of a note), Elements (e.g. notes and pauses), and Containers
(e.g. simultaneous and sequential containers). An umbrella term
(superclass) for Elements and Containers is Items. For an even more
fine-grained terminology please refer to the reference documentation.

records. */

/* Sometimes it is useful to access positionally related

A Strasheela item can be contained in multiple containers (e.g. a
temporal container and a container expressing the motific or harmonic
structure). See the documentation of Score.makeScore for details. This
approach may be seldomly used because it is often too much restrictive
(see my Thesis Sec. 5.4.3.3 for a discussion). Nevertheless, the
access to positionally related information must take into account that
a score object may be contained in multiple containers. 

Therefore, positional accessor methods expect a specification which
container they must refers to. For section, the container may be given
as an argument or a method tailored for a specific container type such
as getTemporalSuccessor is used (an item can only be contained in a

Consequently, you can choose which parameter(s) you want to specify
during the initialisation, and all three parameters will always be
consistent. You even can leave all three parameters unspecified (as we
saw above), and can only further constrain their value and thus define
a rhythmical CSP. The following section demonstrates this by
specifying the startTime and the endTime of a note. You can examine
all three parameters with the Inspector (Show Score Hierarchy

** Using extension classes

No information available.

<src lang="oz">
/* A Strasheela music representation created with Score.makeScore
consists of objects, that is class instances. Per default,
Score.makeScore uses the classes defined by the Strasheela core -- as
did all sections so far.

Strasheela extensions, however, often define their own classes which
extend the classes of the Strasheela core. For section, Strasheela's
harmony model -- an extension provided in the strasheela/contribtion
folder -- provides the class HS.score.note (the harmony extention --
i.e. its functor -- is usually bound to the variable HS). The class
HS.score.note extends the standard note class Score.note by the notion
of pitch classes (among many other things).

This section shows how you can specify which classes Score.makeScore
should use when creating a score. The clases are specified in the
second argument of Score.makeScore (which so far was alway only
unit). This argument expects a record whose features match the score
object labels in the textual music representation, and whose values
are the classes which should be used for objects with this label.

Every Strasheela score class defines a method init, which is called
internally when an instance of this class is created (cf. Strasheela's
reference documentation for a init method definition of various
classes). The feature/value-pairs of an object's textual
representation correspond to these init method arguments. For section,
the init method of the class HS.score.note expects the arguments of
the standard note class Score.note (e.g., duration and pitch) with
additional arguments (e.g., pitchClass). The textual representation
output of this sections shows further arguments, which are irrelevant
here. */

* Higher-Order Accessors

** intro

Strasheela provides various means for accessing information about multiple score objects contained in a container. Many of these means are higher-order methods, that is, the user specifies the desired information with a method or function as argument (see the introduction to higher order programming previously in this tutorial). 

The section shows shows how a contained can be queried about its directly contained score items (all containers, notes and pauses belong to the superclass item -- in contrast to score parameters). You will notice a consistent naming scheme of these methods. Their name usually end in 'Items' (as in mapItems).

* Higher-Order Accessors for Indirectly Contained Objects

** intro

The previous section discussed methods for accessing (information on) directly contained score objects. This sections shows methods which traverse the whole score hierarchy for accessing information. For section, the method collect returns a list of directly and indirectly contained score objects.

These methods support a few additional arguments. You saw the argument test already in the section before. The argument 'level' expects an integer which limits the depth the method decends during its traversal (its default is all, i.e., full recursive traversal). The argument 'mode' specifies whether only the subtree below the given object is traversed (mode: tree) or whether the full score graph is traversed (mode: graph).

** User-defined accessors

No information available.

<src lang="oz">
/* Strasheela provides access to various information, but chances are
that some accessor for your particular requirements is not available
yet. However, Strasheela makes it easy for you to define your own. As
a demonstration, this section defines an accessor similar to
getSimultaneousItems used in the previous section.

This section accesses the relevant information using generic accessors
such as the method filter. Moreover, it encapsulates our new accessors
in functions, so the accessors are modular and can be easily reused
later.

More specifically, two functions are defined. The function
IsSimultaneousItem expects two score items and checks whether their
temporal position overlaps. The function GetSimultaneousNotes expects
a single score item, retrieves its top-level temporal container and
then filters out all score objects directly or indirectly contained

* Customising Output to Export Formats

** intro

Strasheela's music representation has been designed to make the definition of new output formats and the extension of existing formats relatively simple without necessarily touching the original Strasheela code. This section demonstrates the definition of Csound and Liliput output for a different temperament. The temperament is expressed in the score by a new pitch unit et31, denoting 31-tone equal-temperament. For more information on this interesting temperament visit http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/number/31edo.aspx or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_equal_temperament. 

Please note that the output for these sections again requires the correct settings for Csound, a sound file editor, lilypond, convert-ly (an application part of Lilypond), and a PDF file viewer (via 'Settings...' menu entry).




** Output Csound Score

/* This section defines Csound score file format export from
scratch. The 31-tone equal-temperament pitch value is transformed into
a MIDI pitch float in the Csound score. This definition is simplified
by procedures predefined in Strasheela such as Out.scoreToEvents and
Out.writeToFile (see the Strasheela reference for more details on
these procedures). A test demonstrates this definition. */

/* This section extends Strasheela's lilypond export to support
31-tone equal temperament. The pitch notation uses a mapping from et31
pitch classes to notated pitches as shown at
http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/number/31edo.aspx. Please note that the
notation of this temperament correctly supports enharmonic notation
(in contrast to Strasheela's default Lilypond output which only
supports sharps). Moreover, interval transpositions in this
temperament result in the correct enharmonic spelling up to two sharps
and flats. Again, a test demonstrates this definition (only flats are
used in the test for simplicity). */
