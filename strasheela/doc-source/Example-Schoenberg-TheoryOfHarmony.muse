* Overview

; Example strongly influenced by Schoenberg, but does not always follow exactly (e.g., sometimes add constraints, sometimes generalise)


* Simplified Root Progression Constraint: Harmonic Band

* Cadencing 

The following examples end in a cadence. The constraint used here is not Schoenberg's rule, but this concise constraint stems from Rothenberg. 
Added constraint: union of the pitch classes of the last three chords equals the pitch class set of the scale (C major).

[[../examples/Output/Schoenberg-cadence1.mp3][../examples/Output/Schoenberg-cadence1.png]]

Demonstrate effect of this constraint: now the last 4 chords form a cadence in the sence that the pitch classes of these chords together form the Bb major scale.

* Using Different Inversions

Sixth chords can be used freely

* Revised Root Progression Rules

[[../examples/Output/Schoenberg-revisedProgression1.mp3][../examples/Output/Schoenberg-revisedProgression1.png]]

Purely asdencing progression

* Dissonance Treatment


Liberal dissonance treatment (a Non-Schoenberg rule): if dissonance, then do ascending progression

** Allow for seventh chords

* Modulation 

  *TODO*


* Using Non-Conventional Chords and Scales

** Septimal Minor 

This example uses the septimal minor scale. 

 *TODO: pict of septimal minor*
 
Example uses only scale notes. Only root inversion. More simple rule for connecting chords again: harmonic band. 4 chords form a cadence.
The analysis shows the ratios approximated by the tuning.

** Hahn pentachordal


This example uses a pentachordal scale proposed by Paul Hahn.

 *TODO: pict of Hahn's pentachordal*

Example uses only scale notes. Only root inversion.
Only ascending progression. 4 chords form a cadence.

[[../examples/Output/Schoenberg-pentachordal1.mp3][../examples/Output/Schoenberg-pentachordal1.png]]

Using 1st inversion as well.

[[../examples/Output/Schoenberg-pentachordal2.mp3][../examples/Output/Schoenberg-pentachordal2.png]]


* Implementation Comments

Example is implemented in such a way that the creation of the abstract harmony (e.g., the analytical harmonic information, in contrast to the actual notes) is defined in a modular way. In other words, the harmonic CSP without the four-voice voiceleading rules can be reused in other constraint problems, for example harmonic counterpoint problems where the polyphonic structure depends on some underlying harmony.
