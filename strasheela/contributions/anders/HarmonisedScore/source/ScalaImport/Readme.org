This folder contains an unfinished attempt to write a parser for the chord and scale definitions of the Scala software. Gump has been used to write this parser.

The ScalaScanner.oz should be finished (largely), but the ScalaParser.oz is unfinished and contains severe bugs. My main problem was to understand the Gump syntax for the parser definition -- the Gump manual is hard to digest.

So, instead I now translated parts of the Scala chord and scale definitions manually into Strasheela HS databases.
