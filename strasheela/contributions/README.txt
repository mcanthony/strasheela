This folder 'contributions' contains extensions to the Strasheela core provided by Strasheela users. The Strasheela core itself aims to be minimalistic and highly generic. For instance, the core aims not to define any score datatypes which are specific only to a certain musical style or a family of styles. Instead, such datatypes are -- among other things -- provided as Strasheela extensions in this contributions folder. Nontheless, this folder is indented for Strasheela extensions which are generic enough to be useful for more then one Strasheela project. Application examples, on the other hand, can be found in the 'examples' folder.
