#+CATEGORY: Strasheela

* Strasheela release
   

** Get Strasheela working with new Mozart 1.4.0
*** TODO Install Mozart 1.4.0 
    Install as App on Mac, then you can switch between old and new installation by vars in ~/.profile

    I also need to comment out all Oz-related stuff in ~/.emacs to use the 1.4.0 App

*** TODO Test Strasheela with new Mozart version
    
*** TODO Test parallel search

*** TODO Release next version 

* Strasheela Bugs


** TODO Bug: Archiving score (e.g., with Out.saveScore) with strings: double quotes of strings are lost

declare
MyScore = {Score.makeScore note(info:"test")
	   unit}

{Out.saveScore MyScore unit}

% then check output test file..


* Strasheela design						    :STRASHEELA:


** TODO Create variant for Out.saveScore using pickles

   Some score objects (e.g., Fenvs which contain procs) cannot be translated into text (code), i.e. cannot be "archived". However, they could be picked! 

   On the other hand, pickling not supported for undetermined values. Can I have an approach which works for both cases (translates undetermined vars into text/code which would be compiled into Oz values during loading.)


** Define how fenvs of prototype motifs can be variated with motif instance arguments 

   [this is actually a Strasheela TODO..]

   See [[file:MidiOut_toTassman/MusicRepresentationForTassmanPiece.org::*Prototype%20Motif%20Variation][file:MidiOut_toTassman/MusicRepresentationForTassmanPiece.org::*Prototype Motif Variation]]

*** TODO Extend ProtoMotif 'scriptArgs'

    see [[file:MidiOut_toTassman/MusicRepresentationForTassmanPiece.org::*Prototype%20Motif%20Variation][file:MidiOut_toTassman/MusicRepresentationForTassmanPiece.org::*Prototype Motif Variation]]

*** TODO Check my ideas out with simple motif prototype (e.g., with fenvs at different levels) and motif instance args
