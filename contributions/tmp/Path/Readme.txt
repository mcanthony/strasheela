This functor contains a fix of the Mozart stdlib/os/path. I will fix things in svn too -- as soon the fixed version is released I can remove this functor and all references to it. For now, I make the fixed functor a part of Strasheela to make sure things work with the Mozart release (I don't expect people to checkout svn and compile Mozart for themselves..).

I haven't touched the functor Shell.oz at all, I only leave a copy of it here to get things working..
